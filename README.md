Welcome to my CRUD app!

- I was unable to get the back end working unfortunately. I spent quite a bit of time googling and working on understanding and putting in practice my findings, but I was short on time, and couldn't get thigs fully functionning. 

- I decided to stick to everything I know for now, and to store data in Firebase and work in React in order to submit a working app.

- I made a simple, one component CRUD app, the acts as an people address book. You can add new people in your network, and delete them from the database.

- My thought process was to make sure that I had a functionning app, so I decided to store the inputs in state, set up firebase to be able to have reccuent data, and use the remove module from firebase.

- The hardest part for me was being able to map through all the data from the different inputs. Basically, storing all the data in the same object.

- If I had had more time, I would have found a way to connect this app to the backend, and I would have also made it pretty with CSS. 

Thank you so much for taking a look at it!
