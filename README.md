Welcome to my CRUD app!

- I was unable to get the back end working unfortunately. I spent a lotof time googling and working on understanding and putting in practice my findings, but I was short on time, and couldn't get thigs fully functionning. 

- I decided to stick to everything I know for now, and to store data in Firebase and work in React in order to submit a working app.

- I made a simple, one component CRUD app, the acts as an people address book. You can add new people in your network, and delete them whenever you no longer want them there (rude).
